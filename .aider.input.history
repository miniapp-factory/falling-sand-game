+Code the following app
+```
+a canvas-based falling sand simulation game. The screen acts as a drawing board where the user can paint with different elements selected from a toolbar. Include "Sand" (yellow, falls down and piles up), "Water" (blue, falls and flows sideways to fill containers), "Stone" (grey, completely static and blocks movement), and "Eraser". The simulation must run a loop checking every pixel's state to update positions realistically. Allow the user to draw by clicking and dragging. The background should be dark to make the neon-colored elements pop visually. Make it look fun and colourful styling. 
+Place the canvas to the home page.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

+update the simulation to initialize a solid Stone border along all four edges of the canvas. This border must be strictly indestructible and irreplaceable: modify the user interaction logic to ensure that painting or erasing simply ignores any pixel identified as part of this boundary wall.

+introduce a Fire element (Red/Orange neon). Fire acts as a rising gas with negative gravity, moving upwards and drifting sideways to simulate flickering flames. It should have a random decay factor so pixels burn out over time. Add a corresponding button to the toolbar.

+Modify the physics of the Fire element. It must no longer rise. Change its gravity to be positive so it falls down and flows sideways like a heavy liquid or lava.

+introduce a Plant element (Bright Green). Plants are static and do not fall. Implement two biological interactions: 1) Growth: If a Plant pixel touches Water, it absorbs the water and grows a new Plant pixel in a random adjacent empty space (simulating roots/branches). 2) Flammability: If a Plant pixel touches Fire, it instantly catches fire and transforms into Fire, allowing the flames to spread rapidly.
